## So how did I got into this?

The other day I was working on a project from
[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) specifically the REST
Countries API with color theme switcher challenge. So I ran into this problem
where I was trying to define all the types of the whole object that I received
by from the http Response to validate it with Zod.

I was fetching the data from
[the rest countries API](https://restcountries.com/) to print the response on
the console of Chrome Dev Tools. So I questioned myself, how can I copy the
response from the console? I tried to copy the response but it didn't work.

So I started to search on the internet and I found this small tip to copy the
response from the console. Next I found out that there were 2 options to copy
the response from the console.

## Option 1

The first option is to right click on the response and click on the
`Store as global variable` option. After that you can copy that temporary
variable from the console writing inside de console `copy(temporaryVariable)`.
Finally you can paste the response wherever you want.

## Option 2

The second option is to right click on the response and click on the
`Copy object` option.
