## So how did I got into this?

<br/>

Hacktoberfest is a yearly event that brings together developers from all over the world to contribute to open source projects and earn rewards. This year, I had the opportunity to participate in this amazing event, and I must say, it was a great experience.

<br/>

For those who are not familiar with Hacktoberfest, it is a global celebration of open source software, organized by DigitalOcean and DEV. The aim is to encourage people to get involved in open source development and to give back to the community. To participate, all you need to do is make five or more pull requests to any public GitHub repository during the month of October.

<br/>

This year, I decided to participate in Hacktoberfest as a way to challenge myself and learn new things. I had been wanting to get involved in open source for a long time, but I never found the time to do so. I figured that this was the perfect opportunity to start.

<br/>

The process of contributing to an open source project was much simpler than I had anticipated. I started by browsing through the list of projects on GitHub that were labeled as "good for beginners" and found one that was of interest to me. The project that I decided to start contributing was [Astro JS](https://astro.build/). I read through the project's documentation and got an idea of what needed to be done. Then, I forked the repository, made the changes, and submitted a pull request.

<br/>

I was pleasantly surprised by the friendly and supportive community. The project maintainers were quick to review my pull request and provide feedback. They also encouraged me to contribute to more issues and provided guidance on how to get started.

<br/>

Overall, participating in Hacktoberfest was a great experience. Not only did I get the chance to contribute to an open source project, but I also learned a lot about Git, GitHub, and the open source community. I'm already looking forward to Hacktoberfest 2023!

<br/>

In conclusion, I would highly recommend Hacktoberfest to anyone who is interested in open source development. It's a great opportunity to learn new things, get involved in the open source community, and make a positive impact. So, mark your calendars for October 2023 and get ready to contribute!
