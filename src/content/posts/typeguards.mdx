Type guards are a key TypeScript feature that enables you to build code that is
more resistant to runtime mistakes. In this post, we'll look at type guards, how
to use them, and some best practices for putting them in place.

## What are type guards?

**TypeScript** is a typed programming language, which means that variables and
functions have a predefined type. When working with data from external sources
(for example, user input or API answers), it might be difficult to confirm that
the data is of the correct type. Type guards are very handy here.

A type guard is a piece of code that verifies the type of a variable during
runtime and changes the variable's type as needed. Assume you have a variable
data, which might be a string or an object:

```ts
let data: string | object = 'hello'
```

If you wish to access a data property that exists exclusively on the object
type, you must first check the data type:

```ts
if (typeof data === 'object') {
  console.log(data.property) // error: property does not exist on type string
}
```

The `typeof` operator determines the `data` type, and the if statement
establishes a type guard that guarantees data is an object before accessing its
property property.

Type guards can be implemented as functions as well. As an example, suppose you
have an interface Person:

```ts
interface Person {
  name: string
  age: number
}
```

You can define a type guard function isPerson that checks whether an object has
the properties name and age:

```ts
function isPerson(obj: any): obj is Person {
  return obj && typeof obj.name === 'string' && typeof obj.age === 'number'
}
```

The obj is Person syntax tells TypeScript that the function is a type guard that
changes the type of obj to Person.

Now you can use the isPerson function to check whether an object is a Person:

```ts
let data: any = { name: 'Paul', age: 30 }

if (isPerson(data)) {
  console.log(data.name) // "Paul"
}
```

## Using type guards

Type guards are most commonly used to handle data from external sources, such as
user input or API responses. For example, let's say you have a function that
fetches data from an API:

```ts
async function getData() {
  const response = await fetch('https://example.com/api')
  const data = await response.json()
  return data
}
```

The `fetchData` function returns an object of type any, which means that
TypeScript doesn't know what properties the object has. You can use a type guard
to check the type of the returned data and handle different cases accordingly:

```ts
async function fetchData(): Promise<void> {
  const response = await fetch('/api/data')
  const data = await response.json()

  if (isPerson(data)) {
    // handle Person data
  } else if (Array.isArray(data)) {
    // handle array data
  } else {
    // handle other data types
  }
}
```

## Best practices

**Use type guards to make your code more expressive:** Type guards can help make
your code more readable and expressive by making it clear what types of values
your code is expecting.

**Use user-defined type guards when working with custom types:** If you're
working with custom types, it's a good idea to define your own type guards to
help TypeScript narrow down the types of variables at runtime.

**Use type guards with switch statements:** Type guards can be especially useful
when used with switch statements. By checking the type of a value with a type
guard in each case statement, you can avoid errors and make your code more
reliable.

**Avoid using type assertions:** Type assertions can be tempting, but they can
be dangerous if used incorrectly. Instead, use type guards to help TypeScript
infer the types of variables at runtime.

**Be aware of performance implications:** Type guards can have performance
implications, especially if they're used in performance-critical code. Make sure
to test your code and optimize where necessary.

## Conclusion

Overall, type guards are a powerful feature of TypeScript that can help make
your code more reliable and expressive. By following these best practices, you
can use type guards effectively and avoid common pitfalls.
