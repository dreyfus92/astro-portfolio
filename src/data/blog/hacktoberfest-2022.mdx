## So how did I got into this?

Hacktoberfest is a yearly event that brings together developers from all over
the world to contribute to open source projects and earn rewards. This year, I
had the opportunity to participate in this amazing event, and I must say, it was
a great experience.

For those who are not familiar with Hacktoberfest, it is a global celebration of
open source software, organized by DigitalOcean and DEV. The aim is to encourage
people to get involved in open source development and to give back to the
community. To participate, all you need to do is make five or more pull requests
to any public GitHub repository during the month of October.

This year, I decided to participate in Hacktoberfest as a way to challenge
myself and learn new things. I had been wanting to get involved in open source
for a long time, but I never found the time to do so. I figured that this was
the perfect opportunity to start.

The process of contributing to an open source project was much simpler than I
had anticipated. I started by browsing through the list of projects on GitHub
that were labeled as "good for beginners" and found one that was of interest to
me. The project that I decided to start contributing was
[Astro JS](https://astro.build/). I read through the project's documentation and
got an idea of what needed to be done. Then, I forked the repository, made the
changes, and submitted a pull request.

I was pleasantly surprised by the friendly and supportive community. The project
maintainers were quick to review my pull request and provide feedback. They also
encouraged me to contribute to more issues and provided guidance on how to get
started.

Overall, participating in Hacktoberfest was a great experience. Not only did I
get the chance to contribute to an open source project, but I also learned a lot
about Git, GitHub, and the open source community. I'm already looking forward to
Hacktoberfest 2023!

In conclusion, I would highly recommend Hacktoberfest to anyone who is
interested in open source development. It's a great opportunity to learn new
things, get involved in the open source community, and make a positive impact.
So, mark your calendars for October 2023 and get ready to contribute!
