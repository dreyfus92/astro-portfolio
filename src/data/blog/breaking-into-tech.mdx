## Who am I?

I am a **civil engineer** graduated from National Autonomous University of
Mexico (UNAM), I've worked in the field for 7 years, specifically in
construction and project management. I've always been interested in technology,
but I never had the opportunity to study it, so I decided to learn it on my own.

## So how it all started?

It was October 22, 2021 when I decided it was time to take a break from civil
engineering due to multiple factors and I knew it was time to try something
else. I was very frightened about the taking this decision cause of what I read
in that time about other people's journey and how some just ditched the journey
and went back to their old jobs. Nonetheless, I decided to keep going with the
plan. After my decision was made, I quitted my job and started learning how to
code.

My journey started on November, I knew that I needed to look for good resources
to learn from. Some resources popped up on my screen and I started with
[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). After spending the first month
learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I found about the
[Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), which was another resource to
keep practicing and learning. I started with the Odin Project and I was able to
finish most of the courses.

When I found out that I was able to get my hands on React I discovered
[Scrimba's React course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact). Completed the
whole course and fall in love with React's ecosystem. I was able to build a
couple of projects with React. I finished
[Scrimba's Frontend Developer Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend) in
May 2022. After that all pieces of the puzzle started to fit.

## What's next?

After finishing the Odin Project and Scrimba's React course, I decided it was
time to look for a job. I started applying to different job posts and I got a
couple of interviews, until I got a position as a **Frontend Developer** at
[Hackapulco](https://www.hackapulco.com/). I was very excited that I could land
a job in a complete new field. I'm looking forward to keep learning and growing
as a developer.
