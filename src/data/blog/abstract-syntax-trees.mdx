# What are Abstract Syntax Trees?

At a high level an Abastract Syntax Tree (AST) is an intermediate representation
of source code as a tree structure.

## But what does that actually mean?

The AST is a tree-like structure that represents the structure of the code in a
way that is easier to manipulate and analyze than the original source code. Each
node in the tree represents a construct in the code, such as a function, a loop,
or an if statement. The children of each node represent the sub-constructs that
make up the construct.

ASTs are often used in compiler design to parse source code and generate an
intermediate representation of the code. The intermediate representation can
then be optimized or transformed before generating the final executable code.
ASTs are also used in code analysis tools to perform tasks such as refactoring,
linting, and code completion.

## How do I get an AST?

JavaScript ecosystem has a lot of tools that can generate ASTs from source code.
The most popular one is [Babel](https://babeljs.io/). Babel is a JavaScript
compiler that can parse source code and generate an AST. Babel can also
generates code from an AST.

Let's see an example of how an AST would look like:

{/* Image goes here */}

You can tell by the picture that the root node is the plus sign. The children of
the root node are the number 2 and the multiplication sign which has 2 children
of its own, which are 2 numbers. This follows a hierarchy of signs and can be as
well represented in JSON format.

```json
{
  "type": "BinaryExpression",
  "left": {
    "type": "NumericLiteral",
    "value": 2
  },
  "operator": "+",
  "right": {
    "type": "BinaryExpression",
    "left": {
      "type": "NumericLiteral",
      "value": 8
    },
    "operator": "*",
    "right": {
      "type": "NumericLiteral",
      "value": 9
    }
  }
}
```
