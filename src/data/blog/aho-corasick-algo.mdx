The other day, I stumbled upon this algorithm and was truly captivated by its
brilliance. I couldn't resist the urge to share it with all of you, so here it
is.

## A bit of historical background

The Aho-Corasick algorithm (hereinafter "A-C") was conceived by Alfred V. Aho
and Margaret J. Corasick. A-C was introduced in their seminal paper titled
"Efficient string matching: An aid to bibliographic search," published in 1975.
This work was aimed at addressing the computational challenges associated with
bibliographic search, which is a crucial aspect of academic research and
literary work management.

During the 1970s, bibliographic search was emerging as a critical challenge,
especially with the burgeoning volume of academic literature. The need for
efficient string matching algorithms was glaring, as traditional approaches were
notably inefficient when tasked with searching for multiple patterns within
large text corpora.

A-C is built upon earlier theoretical work in automata theory and the theory of
computation. It leverages the power of trie data structures and finite automata
to perform efficient string matching. The algorithm's elegance lies in its
simplicity and efficiency, making a single pass over the text, regardless of the
number of patterns.

## The Trie Structure

The journey begins with a data structure known as Trie, a type of search tree
used to store a collection of strings. Each node in this tree represents a
character, and a path from the root to a node spells out a word. This structure
serves as the backbone of our algorithm, providing a map for the patterns we
seek.

## Constructing the Trie

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 gap-6 md:grid-cols-2 md:gap-10">
  <div>
    Given a set of words, say `{"he", "she", "his", "hers"}`, the algorithm constructs a Trie. 
    This process is akin to creating a directory where each word gets its own unique address 
    based on its characters. As each word is processed, it's broken down into individual characters 
    which guide the formation of branches in the Trie. The commonality between the starting 
    characters of different words is utilized to create shared branches, thus optimizing 
    the structure.

    For example, the words "he" and "hers" both start with the character 'h', so
    they share the initial branch. As we move to the next character, new branches
    are formed to accommodate the differences. This setup ensures that each word has
    a unique path within the Trie, yet common prefixes are represented efficiently.

## Crafting Failure Links

The algorithm then adorns the Trie with failure links, a mechanism to gracefully
retreat and advance along different branches when a mismatch occurs. These links
conect nodes in a manner that encapsulates the shared prefixes among the words,
creating a network of fallbacks. It's akin to having secret passages that
swiftly guide the search to the right path upon encountering a hurdle.

## The Search Begins

With a well-prepared Trie, the search commences. As the algorithm traverses the
text, it follows the branches of the Trie, character by character. Each match
propels it deeper into the Trie, while a mismatch ushers it along the failure
links to the next potential matching position. This dance continues, seamlessly
transitioning between the text and the Trie, leaving no stone unturned.

## Harvesting the Matches

Whenever the traversal reaches the end of a word in the Trie, a match is found!
The position of the match within the text is recorded, and the search marches on
unfazed, in pursuit of other patterns.

## The result

At the conclusion of this expedition, the algorithm presents a comprehensive
list of all ocurrences of the words within the text. A-C's ability to find
multiple patterns in a single pass makes it a cherished asset in the toolbox of
text processing.

## Implementation

For those desiring a more tangible grasp, here is a TypeScript implementation of
the Aho-Corasick algorithm.

We will start by defining the max number of states in `buildMatchingMachine` and
the max number of characters in the alphabet.

```ts
const MAX_STATES = 500
const MAX_CHARS = 26
```

Next we will define the `AhoCorasick class`, which will be responsible for
constructing the Trie and performing the search.

```ts
class AhoCorasick {
  private out: number[] = new Array(MAX_STATES).fill(0)
  private f: number[] = new Array(MAX_STATES).fill(-1)
  private g: number[][] = new Array(MAX_STATES)
    .fill(null)
    .map(() => new Array(MAX_CHARS).fill(-1))

  constructor(private keywords: string[]) {}

  /**
   * Builds the Aho-Corasick machine, initializing the goto, failure,
   * and output functions.
   * @returns The total number of states in the machine.
   */

  private buildMatchingMachine(): number {
    this.out.fill(0)
    this.g = new Array(MAX_STATES)
      .fill(null)
      .map(() => new Array(MAX_CHARS).fill(-1))

    let states = 1

    for (let i = 0; i < this.keywords.length; ++i) {
      const word = this.keywords[i]
      let currentState = 0

      for (let j = 0; j < word.length; ++j) {
        const ch = word.charCodeAt(j) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)

        if (this.g[currentState][ch] === -1) {
          this.g[currentState][ch] = states++
        }

        currentState = this.g[currentState][ch]
      }

      this.out[currentState] |= 1 << i
    }

    for (let ch = 0; ch < MAX_CHARS; ++ch) {
      if (this.g[0][ch] === -1) {
        this.g[0][ch] = 0
      }
    }

    this.f.fill(-1)

    const q: number[] = []
    for (let ch = 0; ch < MAX_CHARS; ++ch) {
      if (this.g[0][ch] !== 0) {
        this.f[this.g[0][ch]] = 0
        q.push(this.g[0][ch])
      }
    }

    while (q.length) {
      const state = q.shift()!

      for (let ch = 0; ch < 26; ++ch) {
        if (this.g[state][ch] !== -1) {
          let failure = this.f[state]

          while (this.g[failure][ch] === -1) {
            failure = this.f[failure]
          }

          failure = this.g[failure][ch]
          this.f[this.g[state][ch]] = failure

          this.out[this.g[state][ch]] |= this.out[failure]

          q.push(this.g[state][ch])
        }
      }
    }

    return states
  }

  /**
   * Finds the next state based on the current state and the next input character.
   * @param currentState - The current state in the machine.
   * @param nextInput - The next input character.
   * @returns The next state in the machine.
   */

  private findNextState(currentState: number, nextInput: string): number {
    let answer = currentState
    const ch = nextInput.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)

    while (this.g[answer][ch] === -1) {
      answer = this.f[answer]
    }

    return this.g[answer][ch]
  }

  /**
   * Searches for all occurrences of the keywords in the given text.
   * @param text - The text to search.
   */

  public searchWords(text: string): void {
    if (!text) {
      console.log('The text to search cannot be empty or null.')
      return
    }

    this.buildMatchingMachine()

    let currentState = 0

    for (let i = 0; i < text.length; ++i) {
      currentState = this.findNextState(currentState, text[i])

      if (this.out[currentState] === 0) continue

      for (let j = 0; j < this.keywords.length; ++j) {
        if (this.out[currentState] & (1 << j)) {
          console.log(
            `Word ${this.keywords[j]} appears from ${
              i - this.keywords[j].length + 1
            } to ${i}`,
          )
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

And finally we will use the class to search for the words in a given text.

```ts
const arr = ['he', 'she', 'hers', 'his', 'a']
const text = 'ahishers'
const ahoCorasickMachine = new AhoCorasick(arr)
ahoCorasickMachine.searchWords(text)

// Output:
// Word his appears from 1 to 3
// Word he appears from 4 to 5
// Word she appears from 3 to 5
// Word hers appears from 4 to 7
```
